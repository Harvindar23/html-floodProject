      Some methods of flood control have been practiced since ancient times. These methods include planting vegetation to retain extra water, terracing hillsides to slow flow downhill, and the construction of floodways (man-made channels to divert floodwater). Other techniques include the construction of levees, dikes, dams, reservoirs or retention ponds to hold extra water during times of flooding.

      <h3>Methods of Control</h3>
    </div>
    <p>In many countries, rivers prone to floods are often carefully managed. Defences such as levees, bunds, reservoirs, and weirs are used to prevent rivers from bursting their banks. When these defences fail, emergency measures such as sandbags or portable inflatable tubes are used. Coastal flooding has been addressed in Europe and the Americas with coastal defences, such as sea walls, beach nourishment, and barrier islands.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A dike is another method of flood protection. A dike lowers the risk of having floods compared to other methods. It can help prevent damage; however it is better to combine dikes with other flood control methods to reduce the risk of a collapsed dike.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    A weir, also known as a lowhead dam, is most often used to create millponds, but on the Humber River in Toronto, a weir was built near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymore_Drive"><em>Raymore Drive</em></a> to prevent a recurrence of the flooding caused by Hurricane Hazel in 1954, which destroyed nearly two fifths of the street.</p>

      <h4>Europe</h4>

    <p>London is protected from flooding by a huge mechanical barrier across the River Thames, which is raised when the water level reaches a certain point.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The largest and most elaborate flood defenses can be found in the Netherlands, where they are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Works"><em>Delta Works</em></a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Scheldt"><em>Oosterschelde</em></a>  dam as its crowning achievement. These works were built in response to the North Sea flood of 1953, in the southwestern part of the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>Another elaborate system of floodway defenses can be found in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The Red River flows northward from the United States, passing through the city of Winnipeg (where it meets the Assiniboine River) and into Lake Winnipeg. As is the case with all north-flowing rivers in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, snowmelt in southern sections may cause river levels to rise before northern sections have had a chance to completely thaw. This can lead to devastating flooding, as occurred in Winnipeg during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_Red_River_flood"><em>spring of 1950</em></a>. To protect the city from future floods, the Manitoba government undertook the construction of a massive system of diversions, dikes, and floodways (including the Red River Floodway and the Portage Diversion). The system kept Winnipeg safe during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Red_River_flood"><em>1997 flood</em></a> which devastated many communities upriver from Winnipeg, including Grand Forks, North Dakota and Ste. Agathe, Manitoba.</p>
  
  <br>
  <p>In an act of successful flood prevention, the Federal Government of the United States offered to buy out flood-prone properties in the United States in order to prevent repeated disasters after the 1993 flood across the Midwest. Several communities accepted and the government, in partnership with the state, bought 25,000 properties which they converted into wetlands. These wetlands act as a sponge in storms and in 1995, when the floods returned, the government did not have to expend resources in those areas.</p>

  <p>China has an extensive system of dams, reservoirs, and river management projects to control flooding, including the Three Gorges Dam. The country also invests in early warning systems and flood response teams.</p>
  
  <br>
  <p>South Korea: South Korea has constructed extensive flood control infrastructure, such as dams and reservoirs, and maintains early warning systems to manage riverine and monsoon flooding.</p>

  <br>
  <p>India have implemented safety measures to mitigate the impact of flooding. Some of the states in India that have implemented safety measures for floods include:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Assam:</b> Assam is one of the most flood-prone states in India, and the government has implemented measures such as embankments, flood forecasting, rescue and relief operations, and the Assam State Disaster Management Authority to deal with floods.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Bihar:</b> Bihar experiences regular flooding due to its proximity to the Ganges and other rivers. The government has taken steps to construct embankments, flood shelters, and improve early warning systems.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Kerala:</b> Kerala has taken measures to address flooding through the construction of check dams, reservoirs, and the implementation of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Maharashtra:</b> Maharashtra has implemented flood control and management measures, such as the construction of reservoirs and the formation of the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Many countries have proposed that loss of vegetation (deforestation) will lead to a risk increase. With natural forest cover, flood duration should decrease.[citation needed] Deforestation amplifies the incidents and severity of floods</p>

    <h3>Future</h3>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>Europe is at the forefront of the flood control technology. With many countries around Europe at or below the sea level, the problems of floods and rising sea levels are ever increasing. Countries like the Netherlands with projects such as the Zuiderzee works and the Delta works could prove to be important models for other countries around the world to follow. These sorts of humongous projects could be key in combating the increasing effects of global climate change such as: rising sea levels, an increase in the frequency and severity of some natural disasters, and even increased durations of dry or rainy seasons.</p>
